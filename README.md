# TUM NWERC Selection Tool
A tool which 
- fetches the relevant contests for the selection of the TUM NWERC teams from Codeforces and AtCoder
- calculates the score for all participants
- shows the ranking among all TUM participants.

## Usage
Install Python 3 and additionally the Python module `requests` as it is not a built-in module.
For running the tool use `python3 main.py`. The current ranking will be printed to the console.
The `runbot.py` file is used to host a Telegram bot for which Telegram API keys are needed.
